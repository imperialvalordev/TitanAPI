# Titan
Imperial Valor's solution to manage part of a mini game network by dynamically spinning up / shutting down servers that can be easily used.
## Requirement
The requirement for such a system came about from the creation of [RunFromTheBeast](https://github.com/imperialvalordev/RunFromTheBeast).  
The plugin should work in tandem with other parts of the network to schedule servers, turning them on and off.

It is very vague purposefully. I just would like to make a proof of concept.
